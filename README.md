# IHF_RL
Generative models have garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents a framework for enhancing generative models through iterative human feedback reinforcement learning (IHF-RL). The approach combines automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, with human feedback to incrementally improve the quality of generated text. This paper details a case study involving the generation of product descriptions from an Amazon dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of IHF-RL in refining model outputs.
